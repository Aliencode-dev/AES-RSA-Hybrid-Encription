# AES-RSA-Hybrid-Encription
Algorithm that hybridize Aes and Rsa encription to create a much more stronger Encryption Type.

first i imported the important libraries needed for the program

under the main class, 
decleared a variable to hold the string to be encripted
used try and catch to make sure any error during the program is caught and properly handled 

Generated an AES key and an RSA key pair

then i encripted the ASE key with the RSA key pair for decription.

using the command line code to pick value "console.readline" i picked in the the message to encode from the user.

then i used the AES key to encript bytes of the data by calliing the encode method

same with the decrypt method.
